---

Contains information about a player's current game state.

Characters are a fundamental object type in Lilia. They are distinct from players, where players are the representation of a person's existence in the server that owns a character, and their character is their currently selected persona. All the characters that a player owns will be loaded into memory once they connect to the server. Characters are saved during a regular interval (`lia.config.CharacterDataSaveInterval`), and during specific events (e.g., when the owning player switches away from one character to another).

They contain all information that is not persistent with the player; names, descriptions, model, currency, etc. For the most part, you'll want to keep all information stored on the character since it will probably be different or change if the player switches to another character. An easy way to do this is to use `lia.char.registerVar` to easily create accessor functions for variables that automatically save to the character object.

## **sync**

**Description**

```lua
character:sync()
