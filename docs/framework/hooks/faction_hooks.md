# Faction Hooks

This page details the various hooks associated with a **Faction** in your schema. These hooks define specific behaviors and actions that occur during different stages of a faction member's lifecycle, such as character creation, spawning, and transfer. Proper implementation of these hooks allows for customized and dynamic interactions within factions.
