# lia.command

---

Registration, parsing, and handling of commands.

Commands can be run through the chat with slash commands or they can be executed through the console. Commands can be manually restricted to certain user groups using a [CAMI](https://github.com/glua/CAMI)-compliant admin mod.

If you are looking for the command structure, you can find it [here](/framework/definitions/command).

### **lia.command.add**

**Description:**  
Creates a new command by registering it with the provided structure. This includes setting up access restrictions, handling aliases, and defining the command's execution behavior.

**Realm:**  
`Shared`

**Parameters:**  
    
- `command` (`string`): Name of the command (recommended in UpperCamelCase).
- `data` (`table`): Data describing the command, adhering to the [`Command Fields`](/framework/definitions/command).

**Usage Example:**
```lua
lia.command.add("Slap", {
    adminOnly = true,
    privilege = "Can Slap",
    onRun = function(client, arguments)
        local target = lia.command.findPlayer(client, arguments[1])
        if target then
            target:TakeDamage(10, client, client)
            client:notify("You slapped " .. target:Nick())
            target:notify(client:Nick() .. " slapped you!")
        end
    end,
    syntax = "<player>"
})
```

### **lia.command.hasAccess**

**Description:**  
Checks if a player has access to execute a specific command. This function determines whether a player is authorized to run a given command based on privileges, admin-only or superadmin-only restrictions, and any custom hooks.

**Realm:**  
`Shared`

**Parameters:**  
    
- `client` (`Player`): The player to check access for.
- `command` (`string`): The name of the command to check access for.

**Returns:**  
    
- `boolean`: Whether the player has access to the command.
- `string`: The privilege associated with the command.

**Usage Example:**
```lua
local canUse, privilege = lia.command.hasAccess(playerInstance, "Ban")
if canUse then
    print("Player can run the command:", privilege)
else
    print("Player does not have access to the command:", privilege)
end
```

- `text` (`string`): The input string to extract arguments from.

**Returns:**
